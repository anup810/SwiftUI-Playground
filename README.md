# SwiftUI-Playground

A collection of small SwiftUI projects to explore and practice different SwiftUI concepts.

This repository contains **various SwiftUI practice projects**, each focusing on a specific SwiftUI concept. The goal is to help understand and experiment with different UI elements, animations, gestures, and state management techniques.

## üìÇ Projects Overview

| Project | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Binding Example** | Learning how `@Binding` works in SwiftUI |
| **Card** | A simple `CardView` UI with discount pricing |
| **State Example** | Understanding `@State` for managing local view state |
| **Environment Object Example** | Using `@EnvironmentObject` for shared data across views |
| **Observed Object Example** | Exploring `@ObservedObject` to manage state in SwiftUI |
| **Image Exploration App** | Experimenting with images, grids, animations, and `AsyncImage` |
| **Mask** | Applying `mask()` to text, shapes, and images for advanced effects |
| **SFSymbols** | Working with `SFSymbols` to create dynamic and scalable icons |
| **Breath Rotate Wiggle** | Animations using `breathe`, `rotate`, and `wiggle` effects |
| **Gestures Demo** | Exploring different gestures including drag, rotation, and magnification |
| **Zoom Transition** | Using `navigationTransition(.zoom)` for animated view transitions |

## üìñ Learning Topics

### üéõ **State Management**
* `@State` - Local state management
* `@Binding` - Sharing state between views
* `@ObservedObject` - Managing state in a class
* `@EnvironmentObject` - Sharing global state

### ‚ú® **SwiftUI Animations**
* `rotationEffect` - Rotating views
* `scaleEffect` - Scaling views
* Wiggle animations for fun UI effects

### üñº **Images & Rendering**
* `AsyncImage` - Loading images from the web
* `mask()` - Clipping images and text with custom shapes
* `SFSymbols` - Using system icons
* `clipShape()` - Applying custom shapes to views

### üìå **Gestures & Interactions**
* `DragGesture` - Moving views with user interaction
* `MagnificationGesture` - Pinch-to-zoom effects
* `RotationGesture` - Rotating views with gestures
* Gesture combinations for complex interactions

### üèó **Layout & UI Design**
* `VStack` & `HStack` - Arranging views in vertical & horizontal stacks
* `LazyVGrid` - Creating flexible grid layouts
* `ZStack` - Layering views on top of each other
* `NavigationStack` - Handling navigation and deep links
